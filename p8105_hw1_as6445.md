# Problem 1

I will be loading the penguins dataset below.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The following includes descriptions of the `penguin` dataset:

-The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns, which means that there are 344
observations and 8 variables. The variable names include species,
island, bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, flipper length in mm, body
mass in grams, sex, and year of data collection.

-The mean of flipper length which is 200.92.

I will now create a scatterplot showing the relationship between bill
length(x) and flipper length(y) using `ggplot`. I used `aes` to assign
the x and y-axis. I also included `color=species` to see the points by
the species categories.

I will also be saving the scatterplot using `ggsave` to export the plot
to a pdf. I have chosen a format of my choice.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

``` r

```

# Problem 2

We are creating a data frame down below. The data frame will include
four vector as listed below: - a random sample of size 10 from a
standard Normal distribution - a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0 - a character vector of length
10 - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

I have assigned random variables to create the character vector and
assigned categories of my choice for the factor vector.

I, then, printed the dataframe to double check if the dataframe was
created correctly..

``` r
hwk_df=
  tibble(
    random=rnorm(n=10),
    logical= random>0,
    v_char= c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    v_fact= factor(c("high", "medium", "low","high", "medium", "low","high", "medium", "low","high" ))
  )

hwk_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##     random logical v_char v_fact
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>  <fct> 
    ##  1  0.532  TRUE    a      high  
    ##  2 -0.0857 FALSE   b      medium
    ##  3 -0.902  FALSE   c      low   
    ##  4  0.391  TRUE    d      high  
    ##  5  1.63   TRUE    e      medium
    ##  6  1.18   TRUE    f      low   
    ##  7  0.760  TRUE    g      high  
    ##  8  0.633  TRUE    h      medium
    ##  9 -1.75   FALSE   i      low   
    ## 10 -0.826  FALSE   j      high

I will now try to take the mean of each vector.

``` r
mean(pull(hwk_df, random))
```

    ## [1] 0.1562612

``` r
mean(pull(hwk_df, logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(hwk_df, v_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hwk_df, v_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hwk_df, v_fact))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hwk_df, v_fact)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The code outputs the mean for the random vector, which has a numerical
vector. The code also outputs the mean for the logical vector. The code
does not output the mean for the character and factor vector. I received
an error saying that “argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA.”

I then used `as.numeric`to convert variables from one type to another
and apply the function to the logical, character, and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hwk_df, logical))
as.numeric(pull(hwk_df, v_char))
as.numeric(pull(hwk_df, v_fact))
```

After applying `as.numeric`, the factor vector is now able to output
values. The values were successfully converted into a numeric value.
However, the character value has produced an error message, “NAs
introduced by coercion.” The character value was not successful in
outputting a mean.

The factor vector was unable to calculate a mean with the `pull`
function, but we can produce the`mean(as.numeric(pull(hwk_df, v_fact)))`
of the factor variable with the `as.numeric` function. From this, it is
evident that R is able to produce ordinal values with the `as.numeric`
function. However, R was unable to convert the character variable into
an numeric value.
